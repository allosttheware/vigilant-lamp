Trying First Repository (again,? please be patient with this humble noob)
I am Alex White from Houston,Texas USA and Im a unemployed Technical support (call center) Rep. 
I want to learn not only IT basics but a real strong programming skill and how to collaborate with code, people and product to really grasp the computing roll I land. I am on my own and I have created business accounts in the past on here and other platforms only for the purposes of learning in retrospect I should not have done that so I am starting from scratch with all of the basics and intend to learn adapt and hopefully network. 
I welcome all criticism about my technical skills and would love to meet developers and do any entry level tasks that they need. 
Tell me if I am doing anything wrong. I want to hear you.
I am tired of being afraid to just try.
Thank you so much.
